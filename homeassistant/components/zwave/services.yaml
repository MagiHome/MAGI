stop_network:
  description: Stop the Z-Wave network, all updates into HASS will stop.

soft_reset:
  description: This will reset the controller without removing its data. Use carefully because not all controllers support this. Refer to controllers manual.

test_network:
  description: This will send test to nodes in the Z-Wave network. This will greatly slow down the Z-Wave network while it is being processed. Refer to OZW.log for details.
